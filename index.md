# Austin Yan's First CS 193 Homework

Some of my favorite parts of the CS 193 course include:
```
- The memes in the PowerPoint
- The funny teachers teaching the course
- Easily accessible PowerPoints
- Learning about the Terminal
- The _"incredibly difficult"_ attendance quizzes :)
- The beginning icebreaker games
- **Swifties**
```
